Mirror test is a behavioral technique, that was developed in 1970 by an American psychologist.
<br>
This is an attempt to determine whether an animal possesses the ability of visual self-recognition.
<br>
After prolonged exposure to their reflected images in mirrors, chimpanzees marked with red dye showed evidence of being able to recognize 
their own reflections. Monkeys did not appear to have this capacity.
